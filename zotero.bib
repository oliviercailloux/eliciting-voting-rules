	abstract = {The topic of preferences is a new branch of machine learning and data mining, and it has attracted considerable attention in artificial intelligence research in recent years. Representing and processing knowledge in terms of preferences is appealing as it allows one to specify desires in a declarative way, to combine qualitative and quantitative modes of reasoning, and to deal with inconsistencies and exceptions in a flexible manner. Preference learning is concerned with the acquisition of preference models from data – it involves learning from observations that reveal information about the preferences of an individual or a class of individuals, and building models that generalize beyond such training data. This is the first book dedicated to this topic, and the treatment is comprehensive. The editors first offer a thorough introduction, including a systematic categorization according to learning task and learning technique, along with a unified notation. The remainder of the book is organized into parts that follow the developed framework, complementing survey articles with in-depth treatises of current research topics in this area. The book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and data mining, and in fields such as multicriteria decision-making and operations research.},

	abstract = {{ELECTRE} {TRI} is a well-known method to assign a set of alternatives to a set of predefined categories, considering multiple criteria. Using this method requires setting many parameters, which is often a difficult task. We consider the case where the Decision Makers ({DMs)} in the decision process are not sure of which values should each parameter take, which may result from uncertain, imprecise or inaccurately determined information, as well as from a lack of consensus among them. This paper discusses the synergy between two approaches developed independently to deal with this difficulty. Both approaches avoid asking for precise values for the parameters. Rather, they proceed to solve the problem in a way that requires from the {DMs} much less effort. The first approach infers the value of parameters from assignment examples provided by the {DMs.} Each assignment example originates mathematical constraints to which the parameter values should satisfy. The second approach considers a set of constraints on the parameter values reflecting the imprecise information that the {DMs} are able to provide. Then, it computes the best and worst categories for each alternative compatible with constraints. This paper proposes a new approach integrating the elicitation phase with robustness analysis, to exploit the synergy between them. It is an interactive approach, where the insight obtained during robustness analyses guides the {DMs} during the elicitation phase.},

	abstract = {We present a new method, called {ELECTREGKMS}, which employs robust ordinal regression to construct a set of outranking models compatible with preference information. The preference information supplied by the decision maker ({DM)} is composed of pairwise comparisons stating the truth or falsity of the outranking relation for some real or fictitious reference alternatives. Moreover, the {DM} specifies some ranges of variation of comparison thresholds on considered pseudo-criteria. Using robust ordinal regression, the method builds a set of values of concordance indices, concordance thresholds, indifference, preference, and veto thresholds, for which all specified pairwise comparisons can be restored. Such sets are called compatible outranking models. Using these models, two outranking relations are defined, necessary and possible. Whether for an ordered pair of alternatives there is necessary or possible outranking depends on the truth of outranking relation for all or at least one compatible model, respectively. Distinguishing the most certain recommendation worked out by the necessary outranking, and a possible recommendation worked out by the possible outranking, {ELECTREGKMS} answers questions of robustness concern. The method is intended to be used interactively with incremental specification of pairwise comparisons, possibly with decreasing confidence levels. In this way, the necessary and possible outranking relations can be, respectively, enriched or impoverished with the growth of the number of pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, the method is able to identify troublesome pieces of preference information which are responsible for incompatibility. The necessary and possible outranking relations are to be exploited as usual outranking relations to work out recommendation in choice or ranking problems. The introduced approach is illustrated by a didactic example showing how {ELECTREGKMS} can support real-world decision problems.},

	abstract = {We present a new method, called {UTA-GMS}, for multiple criteria ranking of alternatives from set A using a set of additive value functions which result from an ordinal regression. The preference information provided by the decision maker is a set of pairwise comparisons on a subset of alternatives A{\textasciicircum}R {\textbackslash}subseteq A, called reference alternatives. The preference model built via ordinal regression is the set of all additive value functions compatible with the preference information. Using this model, one can define two relations in the set A: the necessary weak preference relation which holds for any two alternatives a,b from set A if and only if for all compatible value functions a is preferred to b, and the possible weak preference relation which holds for this pair if and only if for at least one compatible value function a is preferred to b. These relations establish a necessary and a possible ranking of alternatives from A, being, respectively, a partial preorder and a strongly complete relation. The {UTA-GMS} method is intended to be used interactively, with an increasing subset A{\textasciicircum}R and a progressive statement of pairwise comparisons. When no preference information is provided, the necessary weak preference relation is a weak dominance relation, and the possible weak preference relation is a complete relation. Every new pairwise comparison of reference alternatives, for which the dominance relation does not hold, is enriching the necessary relation and it is impoverishing the possible relation, so that they converge with the growth of the preference information. Distinguishing necessary and possible consequences of preference information on the complete set of actions, {UTA-GMS} answers questions of robustness analysis. Moreover, the method can support the decision maker when his/her preference statements cannot be represented in terms of an additive value function. The method is illustrated by an example solved using the {UTA-GMS} software. Some extensions of the method are also presented},

	abstract = {In this chapter we present a new interactive procedure for multiobjective optimization, which is based on the use of a set of value functions as a preference model built by an ordinal regression method. The procedure is composed of two alternating stages. In the first stage, a representative sample of solutions from the Pareto optimal set (or from its approximation) is generated. In the second stage, the Decision Maker ({DM)} is asked to make pairwise comparisons of some solutions from the generated sample. Besides pairwise comparisons, the {DM} may compare selected pairs from the viewpoint of the intensity of preference, both comprehensively and with respect to a single criterion. This preference information is used to build a preference model composed of all general additive value functions compatible with the obtained information. The set of compatible value functions is then applied on the whole Pareto optimal set, which results in possible and necessary rankings of Pareto optimal solutions. These rankings are used to select a new sample of solutions, which is presented to the {DM}, and the procedure cycles until a satisfactory solution is selected from the sample or the {DM} comes to conclusion that there is no satisfactory solution for the current problem setting. Construction of the set of compatible value functions is done using ordinal regression methods called {UTA-GMS} and {GRIP.} These two methods generalize {UTA-like} methods and they are competitive to {AHP} and {MACBETH} methods.

In this paper, we consider a well known multiple criteria sorting method, {ELECTRE} {TRI}, which involves three types of preference parameters: (1) category limits defining the frontiers between consecutive categories, (2) weights and majority level specifying which coalitions form a majority, and (3) veto thresholds characterizing discordance effects. We propose an elicitation procedure to infer category limits from assignment example provided by multiple decision makers. The procedure computes a set of category limits common to all decision makers, with variable weights and vetoes for each decision maker. Hence, the method helps reaching a consensus among decision makers on the category limits, whereas finding a consensus on  weights and vetoes is left aside.
The inference procedure is based on mixed integer linear programming and performs well even for datasets corresponding to real-world decision problems. We provide an illustrative example of the method and analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

If the constraints indicated by the {DM} do not contradict each other (i.e. form a consistent system), then {IRIS} infers a combination of parameter values that reproduces all the sorting examples, indicating also the range of possible assignments of actions to categories that would be possible without violating any of the stated constraints. If the constraints are contradictory (i.e. form an inconsistent system), then {IRIS} suggests a combination of parameter values that minimizes an error function and identifies alternative ways to restore the system’s consistency by removing some constraints.},

The majority graph compactly represents the preferences of the agents and provides enough information to compute the winner. When some preferences are missing, there are various notions of winners, such as the possible winners (that is, winners in at least one completion) or the necessary winners (that is, winners in all completions). In this generalized scenario, we show that using the majority graph to compute winners is not correct, since it may declare as winners candidates that are not so. Nonetheless, the majority graph can be used to compute efficiently an upper or lower approximation of the correct set of winners.},

	abstract = {Within disaggregation–aggregation approach, ordinal regressionaims at inducing parameters of a preference model, for example, parameters of a value function, which represent some holistic preference comparisons of alternatives given by the Decision Maker ({DM).} Usually, from among many sets of parameters of a preference model representing the preference information given by the {DM}, only one specific set is selected and used to work out a recommendation. For example, while there exist many value functions representing the holistic preference information given by the {DM}, only one value function is typically used to recommend the best choice, sorting, or ranking of alternatives. Since the selection of one from among many sets of parameters compatible with the preference information given by the {DM} is rather arbitrary, robust ordinal regressionproposes taking into account all the sets of parameters compatible with the preference information, in order to give a recommendation in terms of necessary and possible consequences of applying all the compatible preference models on the considered set of alternatives. In this chapter, we present the basic principle of robust ordinal regression, and the main multiple criteria decision methods to which it has been applied. In particular, {UTA} {GMS} and {GRIPmethods} are described, dealing with choice and ranking problems, then {UTADIS} {GMS} , dealing with sorting (ordinal classification) problems. Next, we present robust ordinal regression applied to Choquet integral for choice, sorting, and ranking problems, with the aim of representing interactions between criteria. This is followed by a characterization of robust ordinal regression applied to outranking methods and to multiple criteria group decisions. Finally, we describe an interactive multiobjective optimization methodology based on robust ordinal regression, and an evolutionary multiobjective optimization method, called {NEMO}, which is also using the principle of robust ordinal regression.},

It constructs not only the preference relation in the considered set of actions, but it also gives information about intensities of preference for pairs of actions from this set for a given decision maker ({DM).} Distinguishing necessary and possible consequences of preference information on the considered set of actions, {GRIP} answers questions of robustness analysis. The proposed methodology can be seen as an extension of the {UTA} method based on ordinal regression. {GRIP} can also be compared to the {AHP} method, which requires pairwise comparison of all actions and criteria, and yields a priority ranking of actions. As for the preference information being used, {GRIP} can be compared, moreover, to the {MACBETH} method which also takes into account a preference order of actions and intensity of preference for pairs of actions. The preference information used in {GRIP} does not need, however, to be complete: the {DM} is asked to provide comparisons of only those pairs of reference actions on particular criteria for which his/her judgment is sufficiently certain. This is an important advantage comparing to methods which, instead, require comparison of all possible pairs of actions on all the considered criteria. Moreover, {GRIP} works with a set of general additive value functions compatible with the preference information, while other methods use a single and less general value function, such as the weighted-sum.},
